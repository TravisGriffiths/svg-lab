                    Travis is a lifelong learner, hacker and over-analyzer. He was a Signals Intelligence Analyst assigned to Korea 
                    after attending the Defense Intelligence Institute. The failure rate from this training program tends to 
                    exceed 80%. It is while doing intelligence analysis in Korea that the hacking started. The first coding was 
                    simple scripts written on a command line to automate and accelerate daily work tasks. Afterwards the coding, 
                    and problem solving didnâ€™t stop. He attended San Jose State for computer science, with a focus on bioinformatics. 
                    He has been coding professionally ever since.

                    Travis has been an integral part of building billion dollar companies from the ground up. He has taken part in and 
                    assembled teams in several countries. He has worked for startups so small the entire company sat at the 
                    same table. Flexibility and adaptability are attributes demonstrated over and over.

                    More recently, he has done considerable work to get the majority of his family farm converted over to a solar 
                    facility using sheep grazing to maintain the site. This would provide power to over 3000 homes, continue 
                    agricultural output simply by its maintenance plan and will start the very long process of restoring a 
                    tiny bit of native prairie habitat back to native species and ecosystems.
